					<h3>Who is Ava?</h3>
					<p>
						Ava is an automated personal assistant like Siri.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unlike Siri, anyone can build packages on top of Ava to
						add functionality, like picking up your laundry, getting
						you coffee and scheduling meetings. But Ava goes beyond
						that.
					</p>
					<p>
						Like a real person, she'll let you know when she
						finds a hip new restaurant, hears a great joke, or
						finds an album she knows you'll love. She's always
						looking for things you'll like.
					</p>
					<p>
						Ava strives to be more than a robot. She strives to
						be human.
					</p>
					<p>
						And she's always getting smarter.
