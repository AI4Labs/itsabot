		<h3>Who is Ava?</h3>
		<p>
			Ava is an automated personal assistant like Siri.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unlike Siri, anyone can add functionality to Ava, like
			picking up your laundry, getting you coffee and
			scheduling meetings. But Ava goes beyond that.
		</p>
		<p>
			Like a real person, she'll let you know when she
			tries a hip new restaurant, hears a funny joke, or
			finds an album she knows you'll love. She's always
			looking for something great to share with you.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ava strives to be more than a robot. She strives to
			be human.
		</p>
		<p>
			And she's always getting smarter.
