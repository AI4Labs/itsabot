POS files in their original form were downloaded from
http://www.ashley-bovan.co.uk/words/partsofspeech.html (Ashley Bovan). To
compile them, Ashley used the MOBY word lists and UK Advanced Cryptics
Dictionary. Each word was then lowercased using dd:

	dd if=/input.txt of=/output.txt conv=lcase

and stemmed using the porter2 (snowball) algorithm from the included Go code.

Duplicates were then removed using awk:

	awk '!x[$0]++' oldfile.1 > newfile

At this point in time we DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION from Ashley to use these, so we
must obtain permission (and ensure licenses are OK from MOBY/UK Advanced
Cryptics Dictionary) prior to any launch.
