POS files in their original form were downloaded from
http://www.ashley-bovan.co.uk/words/partsofspeech.html (Ashley Bovan). To
compile them, Ashley used the MOBY word lists and UK Advanced Cryptics
Dictionary, and licenses of both have been included in this directory's LICENSE
file. Each word was then lowercased using dd:

	dd if=/input.txt of=/output.txt conv=lcase

At this point in time we DO NOT HAVE PERMISSION from Ashley to use these, so we
must obtain permission prior to any launch.
